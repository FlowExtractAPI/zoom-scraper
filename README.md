## 📊 Sample Output Structure

Every link you submit produces exactly one row — including links that could not be
read, so a link never disappears without an explanation.

### **Cloud Recording** (`zoom.us` / `zoomgov.com`)
```json
{
  "_source": "zoom-scraper",
  "source_url": "https://usdot.zoomgov.com/rec/play/1BDKMjpmHZvv0u4iOzIJ...",
  "url": "https://usdot.zoomgov.com/rec/play/1BDKMjpmHZvv0u4iOzIJ...",
  "status": "success",
  "title": "FHWA Lighting Handbook Webinar - 12 December 2023",
  "recordingType": "recordings",
  "startTime": "2023-12-13T03:32:47.000Z",
  "duration": "1:54:21",
  "duration_seconds": 6861,
  "source_size_mb": 192,
  "video_downloaded": false,
  "video_url": null,
  "video_size": null,
  "has_transcript": true,
  "transcript_info": {
    "transcript": "1
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,649
Welcome, welcome. We'll take a few more minutes...",
    "segment_count": 472
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### **Zoom Clip**
```json
{
  "_source": "zoom-scraper",
  "url": "https://www.zoom.us/clips/share/JPZkgJFuQnesSFxNMYeLaw",
  "status": "success",
  "title": "2025 Freedom to Read Award Winner Bänoo Zan",
  "recordingType": "clips",
  "startTime": "2025-03-03T22:07:35.777Z",
  "duration": "6:25",
  "duration_seconds": 385,

  "has_transcript": true,
  "transcript_info": {
    "transcript": "1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,450
So let's welcome this year's recipient...",
    "segment_count": 42
  }
}
```

### **With Downloads Enabled**
When `download_videos: true` and `downloadTranscript: true`:

```json
{
  "title": "PICO Meeting",
  "recordingType": "recordings",
  "duration": "34:12",
  "video_downloaded": true,
  "video_url": "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/q6VQFhKFOBks7LCTT/records/PICO_Meeting.mp4?signature=...",
  "video_name": "PICO_Meeting.mp4",
  "video_size": "206 MB",
  "has_transcript": true,
  "transcript_info": {
    "transcript": "1
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,390
Micah Tseng: Thank you.",
    "transcript_url": "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/ySHfyw860qMzC74Zr/records/PICO_Meeting.srt",
    "segment_count": 318
  }
}
```

### **A Link That Could Not Be Read**
Reported, never silently dropped:

```json
{
  "url": "https://zoom.us/j/1234567890",
  "status": "skipped",
  "error": "Not a recognised Zoom recording link. Supported: a cloud recording (/rec/play, /rec/share, /rec/component-page on zoom.us or zoomgov.com), a Zoom Clip (/clips/share, /clips/embed), or a Zoom Events session (events.zoom.us). Meeting join links (/j/, /w/, /my/) are not recordings.",
  "error_code": "INVALID_URL"
}
```

`status` is one of:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `success` | Everything requested was extracted |
| `partial_success` | Metadata and transcript came back; the video file did not transfer |
| `failed` | Zoom would not serve this recording (private, passcode-protected, expired, deleted) |
| `skipped` | The link is not a Zoom recording link — nothing was requested from Zoom |

## ⚠️ Smart Memory Management for Video Downloads

When `download_videos` is enabled, this Actor uses **intelligent resource allocation** powered by our specialized [Universal File Downloader](https://apify.com/dz_omar/universal-downloader?fpr=smcx63) to optimize memory usage and prevent failures. The Actor automatically analyzes each video's file size and dynamically allocates the optimal amount of memory needed for successful downloads.

### ✅ **How It Works**

**Dynamic Resource Calculation**: The Actor examines each video file before downloading and calculates the exact memory requirements based on file size, ensuring efficient resource usage without waste.

**Automatic Memory Scaling**: Memory allocation automatically scales from 128MB for small videos up to 32GB for very large files, preventing both resource waste and Out-Of-Memory errors.

**Intelligent Timeout Management**: Download timeouts are calculated based on file size and estimated connection speed, ensuring downloads complete successfully without unnecessary waiting.

**Enterprise-Grade Download Engine**: Powered by our [Universal File Downloader](https://apify.com/dz_omar/universal-downloader?fpr=smcx63) Actor, which provides advanced proxy support, retry mechanisms, and streaming technology for reliable downloads of any size.

### 💡 **Benefits for Users**

- **No Manual Configuration**: You don't need to guess or manually set memory requirements
- **Prevents Failures**: Eliminates OOM crashes that could interrupt your downloads
- **Cost Efficient**: Optimizes resource usage to minimize unnecessary costs
- **Handles Any Size**: From short clips to multi-hour recordings, all processed reliably
- **Batch Processing**: Each video gets its own optimized resource allocation
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Advanced error handling and automatic retry mechanisms
- **Proxy Support**: Built-in proxy rotation for improved download success rates

## 📋 Supported URL Formats

### **Cloud Recordings** — commercial and government
```
https://zoom.us/rec/play/[RECORDING_ID]
https://zoom.us/rec/share/[RECORDING_ID]
https://zoom.us/rec/component-page/[RECORDING_ID]
https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/[RECORDING_ID]
https://[company].zoom.us/rec/play/[RECORDING_ID]       ← vanity subdomain
https://www.zoomgov.com/rec/play/[RECORDING_ID]         ← US government
https://[agency].zoomgov.com/rec/share/[RECORDING_ID]   ← agency subdomain
```

### **Zoom Events**
```
https://events.zoom.us/video/[VIDEO_ID]
https://events.zoom.us/evj/[EVENT]?videoId=[VIDEO_ID]
https://events.zoom.us/ev/[EVENT_ID]
```

### **Zoom Clips**
```
https://zoom.us/clips/share/[CLIP_ID]
https://zoom.us/clips/embed/[CLIP_ID]
https://www.zoom.us/clips/share/[CLIP_ID]
https://zoomclips.zoom.us/clips/share/[CLIP_ID]
```

### **Not Recordings** (reported as `skipped`)
```
https://zoom.us/j/[MEETING_ID]        ← meeting join link
https://zoom.us/w/[WEBINAR_ID]        ← webinar join link
https://zoom.us/my/[USERNAME]         ← personal meeting room
```

On a replay page that holds several recordings ("Total 2 Recordings"), the link you
paste decides which one is extracted — paste the link for the recording you actually
want and you get that one, not the first on the page.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Access Issues**
- **Passcode-protected recordings cannot be read.** The actor has no browser session of
  yours, so a recording that asks for a passcode (or a sign-in) when you open it in a
  browser will come back as `failed`. This is a limit of server-side extraction, not a
  bug — most `/rec/` links are protected this way.
- **Expiration**: recordings and their download links expire; check the link still opens
- **Permissions**: verify the recording is reachable without signing in

### **Missing Content**
- **Transcripts**: Must be enabled by meeting host
- **Private recordings**: May require authentication
- **Expired links**: Contact meeting organizer for new links

### **Performance Issues**
- **Memory errors**: Increase memory allocation for video downloads
- **Large files**: Consider processing individually
- **Network issues**: Check internet connection stability

### **URL Format Errors**
- **Invalid URLs**: Ensure URLs are complete and properly formatted
- **Wrong platform**: Use [Loom Video Scraper](https://apify.com/dz_omar/loom-video-scraper?fpr=smcx63) for Loom URLs
- **Shortened URLs**: Use full Zoom URLs instead of shortened versions

---

## 📊 Dataset Views

The actor provides three specialized dataset views for different use cases:

### **🎬 Overview View**
- One row per link: title, type, date, length, download link, status
- Shows at a glance which links worked and which did not

### **🔍 Detailed View**
- Complete recording information
- Full transcript content inline
- Comprehensive metadata

### **📥 Downloads Only**
- Streamlined view focusing on download links
- File sizes and formats
- Perfect for batch downloading
